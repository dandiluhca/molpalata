# Node.js Backend

This folder contains an Express implementation of the API. It mirrors the Python backend but requires installing npm dependencies.

## Usage

```bash
cd backend_node
npm install  # run once
npm start
```

The server listens on port 3001 and serves the React frontend from the `frontend/` directory.
